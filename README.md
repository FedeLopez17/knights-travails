# Knight's Travails â™ž

###  [Check out the live site](https://fedelopez17.github.io/knights-travails/)! :grin:

## Description:
<p>
This project is part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank">The Odin Project's curriculum</a> and marks the end of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank">TOP's Computer Science mini course.</a><br>
The assignment of this project was to write a function which, given starting and target chessboard coordinates, returns the shortest path a knight piece could take to traverse from the starting coordinates to the target coordinates.
</p>
<p>
In order to build the function, I relied on a tree graph data structure and a breadth-first search algorithm.<br> 
Furthermore, I also decided to make a visual representation, as I figured it would be a fun way to keep honing my CSS skills.
